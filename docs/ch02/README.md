Four basic rules

### Cutting deformation
three deformed regions:
- the plastic defomation region in the cutting layer close to the cutting edge
- in chip bottom layer close to the tool-chip interface
- machined surface layer close to the cutting edge
#### Chip formation

1. shearing slide in the first
始滑面 - 终滑面

2. Deformation cuased by pressing in second
3. D'
### Measuerment of deformation
1. relative slide

平行四边形
2. Deformation coefficient 

正切削，直角
Cutting forces
Cutting heat and temperature
tool wear

### built-up edge
mainly depends on the cutting temperature -> cause to increase gamma o

### Chip types

-  Ribbon chips (continuouse chip) -> plastic better
- Cracked chips -> shear force == the limits of 
- Unit chips -> shear force > the limit
- Splintering chips -> 脆性金属
